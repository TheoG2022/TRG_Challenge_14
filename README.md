# TRG_Challenge_14

## Commit 1
### Step 4
### Used the `SVC` classifier model from SKLearn's support vector machine (SVM) learning method to fit the training data and make predictions based on the testing data. Then reviewed the predictions.

### Step 5 
### Reviewed the classification report associated with the `SVC` model predictions. 

## Commit 2
### Step 6
### Created a predictions DataFrame that contains columns for “Predicted” values, “Actual Returns”, and “Strategy Returns”.

## Commit 3
### Step 7 
### Created a cumulative return plot that shows the actual returns vs. the strategy returns. Save a PNG image of this plot. This will serve as a baseline against which to compare the effects of tuning the trading algorithm.

## Commit 4
###  Used the original training data as the baseline model, fitted another model with the new classifier.


### Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? The new model performed the same. Not better or worse. 

### Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm? The new model performed the same. Not better or worse.
